## PSEUDOCODE

1. Add basic math operator functions
2. Add a serpate function _"operate()"_ which takes one operator and two numbers and calls one of the basic math operator functions
3. Add number buttons to populate a calculator display
4. When the "=" button is pressed it should run the _"operate()"_ function properly

## myNotes

Here I am going to talk about some of the problems I faced when trying to write the code. First of all I cut down
my task into different subtask for example if I want to populate the display of the calculator I started with only being possible
to add one number to it. After it took my a while to change my approach and make it so it is a string and concat together.
While implementing that there was some erros e.g. being able to type _"0123"_ which made the operation function invalid.

Once I figured out how to store the variable and when to convert it to a number for the evaluation the rest of the code was easy to implement.
Such as adding a delete button.

After the functioning was done I went back to my mock up HTML/CSS and make the calculator look more clean for the user. Also an important part
was to add some feedback when a number button or an operator button is clicked/hovered over.

Thank you for reading!
